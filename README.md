<h1 align="center">Deep Neural Network Classification Task with Checkpointing</h1>

<p>
  As students at mid-tier colleges, we often face constrained resources 
  that hinder training deep neural network (DNN) models. To overcome this, 
  we frequently resort to cloud computing services such as Google Colab. 
  However, running DNNs in the cloud introduces its challenges, such as 
  internet connection disruptions and power failures.
</p>

<p>
  This demo implements checkpoint-based model state recovery so that if 
  training is interrupted, you don’t have to start from scratch. It serves  as a simple example for a classification task with automatic resuming.

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>✔️ Written in Pytorch </li>
  <li>✔️ Model summery </li>
  <li>✔️ Saves model weights and optimizer state at configurable intervals</li>
  <li>✔️ Automatically loads the latest checkpoint on restart</li>
  <li>✔️ Manual DPI Image saving ( Helpful for Academic Journals) </li>
  <li>✔️ Minimal dependencies for easy experimentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cautions</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Please save the checkpoint and results in your GDrive if running on Colab </li>
  <li> This is a Basic Demo, Parameters are not optimized </li>
  <li>✔️ Saves model weights and optimizer state at configurable intervals</li>
  <li>✔️ Automatically loads the latest checkpoint on restart</li>
