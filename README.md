<h1 align="center">Deep Neural Network Classification Task with Checkpointing</h1>

<p>
  As students at mid-tier colleges, we often face constrained resources 
  that hinder training deep neural network (DNN) models. To overcome this, 
  we frequently resort to cloud computing services such as Google Colab. 
  However, running DNNs in the cloud introduces its challenges, such as 
  internet connection disruptions and power failures.

<p>
  This demo implements checkpoint-based model state recovery so that if 
  training is interrupted, you don’t have to start from scratch. It serves 
  as a simple example for a classification task with automatic resuming.
